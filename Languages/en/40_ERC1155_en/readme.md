# WTF Solidity Crash Course: 40. ERC1155

I am currently relearning Solidity to reinforce my knowledge of its intricacies and write a "WTF Solidity Crash Course" for beginners (expert programmers may seek out other tutorials). Updates will be given on a weekly basis, covering 1-3 lessons per week.

Twitter: [@0xAA_Science](https://twitter.com/0xAA_Science)

Discord: [WTF Academy](https://discord.gg/5akcruXrsk)

All code and tutorials are open source on Github: [github.com/AmazingAng/WTF-Solidity](https://github.com/AmazingAng/WTF-Solidity)

-----

In this lecture, we will learn about the `ERC1155` standard, which allows a contract to contain multiple types of tokens. We will also issue a modified version of the Boring Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) called `BAYC1155`, which contains 10,000 types of tokens with metadata identical to BAYC.

## `EIP1155`
Both the `ERC20` and `ERC721` standards correspond to a single token contract. For example, if we wanted to create a large game similar to World of Warcraft on Ethereum, we would need to deploy a contract for each piece of equipment. Deploying and managing thousands of contracts is very cumbersome. Therefore, the [Ethereum EIP1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) proposes a multi-token standard called `ERC1155`, which allows a contract to contain multiple homogeneous and heterogeneous tokens. `ERC1155` is widely used in GameFi applications, and well-known blockchain games such as Decentraland and Sandbox use it.

In simple terms, `ERC1155` is similar to the previously introduced non-fungible token standard [ERC721](https://github.com/AmazingAng/WTF-Solidity/tree/main/34_ERC721): In `ERC721`, each token has a `tokenId` as a unique identifier, and each `tokenId` corresponds to only one token; in `ERC1155`, each type of token has an `id` as a unique identifier, and each `id` corresponds to one type of token. This way, the types of tokens can be managed heterogeneously in the same contract, and each type of token has a URL `uri` to store its metadata, similar to `tokenURI` in `ERC721`. The following is the metadata interface contract `IERC1155MetadataURI` for `ERC1155`:

```solidity
/**
 * @dev Optional ERC1155 interface that adds the uri() function for querying metadata
 */
interface IERC1155MetadataURI is IERC1155 {
    /**
     * @dev Returns the URI of the token type `id`.
     */
    function uri(uint256 id) external view returns (string memory);
```

How to distinguish whether a type of token in `ERC1155` is a fungible or a non-fungible token? It's actually simple: if the total amount of a token corresponding to a specific `id` is `1`, then it is a non-fungible token, similar to `ERC721`; if the total amount of a token corresponding to a specific `id` is greater than `1`, then it is a fungible token because these tokens share the same `id`, similar to `ERC20`.

## `IERC1155` Interface Contract

The `IERC1155` interface contract abstracts the functionalities required for `EIP1155` implementation, which includes `4` events and `6` functions. Unlike `ERC721`, since `ERC1155` includes multiple types of tokens, it implements batch transfer and batch balance query, allowing for simultaneous operation on multiple types of tokens.

### `IERC1155` Events
- `TransferSingle` event: released during the transfer of a single type of token in a single token transfer.
- `TransferBatch` event: released during the transfer of multiple types of tokens in a multi-token transfer.
- `ApprovalForAll` event: released during a batch approval of tokens.
- `URI` event: released when the metadata address changes during a change of the `uri`.

### `IERC1155` Functions
- `balanceOf()`: checks the token balance of a single type returned as the amount of tokens owned by `account` for an `id`.
- `balanceOfBatch()`: checks the token balances of multiple types returned as amounts of tokens owned by `account` for an array of `ids`.
- `setApprovalForAll()`: grants approvals to an `operator` of all tokens owned by the caller.
- `isApprovedForAll()`: checks the authorization status of an `operator` for a given `account`.
- `safeTransferFrom()`: performs the transfer of a single type of safe `ERC1155` token from the `from` address to the `to` address. If the `to` address is a contract, it must implement the `onERC1155Received()` function.
- `safeBatchTransferFrom()`: similar to the `safeTransferFrom()` function, but allows for transfers of multiple types of tokens. The `amounts` and `ids` arguments are arrays with a length equal to the number of transfers. If the `to` address is a contract, it must implement the `onERC1155BatchReceived()` function.

## `ERC1155` Receive Contract

Similar to the `ERC721` standard, to prevent tokens from being sent to a "black hole" contract, `ERC1155` requires token receiving contracts to inherit from `IERC1155Receiver` and implement two receiving functions:

- `onERC1155Received()`: function called when receiving a single token transfer, must implement and return the selector `0xf23a6e61`.

- `onERC1155BatchReceived()`: This is the multiple token transfer receiving function which needs to be implemented and return its own selector `0xbc197c81` in order to accept ERC1155 safe multiple token transfers through the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function.

 */

        uint256 value,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (bytes4);

    /**

     * Need to return 0xbc197c81 or `bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)"))`
     */

        address operator,
        address from,
        uint256[] calldata ids,
        uint256[] calldata values,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (bytes4);
}
```

## Main Contract `ERC1155`

The `ERC1155` main contract implements the functions specified by the `IERC1155` interface contract, as well as the functions for minting and burning single/multiple tokens.

### Variables in `ERC1155`

The `ERC1155` main contract contains `4` state variables:

- `name`: token name
- `symbol`: token symbol
- `_balances`: token ownership mapping, which records the token balance `balances` of address `account` for token `id`
- `_operatorApprovals`: batch approval mapping, which records the approval situation of the holder address to another address.

### Functions in `ERC1155`

The `ERC1155` main contract contains `16` functions:

- Constructor: Initializes state variables `name` and `symbol`.
- `supportsInterface()`: Implements the `ERC165` standard to declare the interfaces supported by it, which can be checked by other contracts.
- `balanceOf()`: Implements `IERC1155`'s `balanceOf()` to query the token balance. Unlike the `ERC721` standard, it requires the address for which the balance is queried (`account`) and the token `id` to be provided.

- `balanceOfBatch()`: Implements `balanceOfBatch()` of `IERC1155`, which allows for batch querying of token balances.
- `setApprovalForAll()`: Implements `setApprovalForAll()` of `IERC1155`, which allows for batch authorization, and emits the `ApprovalForAll` event.
- `isApprovedForAll()`: Implements `isApprovedForAll()` of `IERC1155`, which allows for batch query of authorization information.
- `safeTransferFrom()`: Implements `safeTransferFrom()` of `IERC1155`, which allows for safe transfer of a single type of token, and emits the `TransferSingle` event. Unlike `ERC721`, this function not only requires the `from` (sender), `to` (recipient), and token `id`, but also the transfer amount `amount`.
- `safeBatchTransferFrom()`: Implements `safeBatchTransferFrom()` of `IERC1155`, which allows for safe transfer of multiple types of tokens, and emits the `TransferBatch` event.
- `_mint()`: Function for minting a single type of token.
- `_mintBatch()`: Function for minting multiple types of tokens.
- `_burn()`: Function for burning a single type of token.
- `_burnBatch()`: Function for burning multiple types of tokens.
- `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck()`: Safety check for single type token transfers, called by `safeTransferFrom()`, ensures that the recipient has implemented the `onERC1155Received()` function when the recipient is a contract.
- `_doSafeBatchTransferAcceptanceCheck()`: Safety check for multiple types of token transfers, called by `safeBatchTransferFrom()`, ensures that the recipient has implemented the `onERC1155BatchReceived()` function when the recipient is a contract.
- `uri()`: Returns the URL where the metadata of the token of type `id` is stored for `ERC1155`, similar to `tokenURI` for `ERC721`.
- `baseURI()`: Returns the `baseURI`. `uri` is simply `baseURI` concatenated with `id`, and can be overwritten by developers.

## `BAYC`, but as `ERC1155`

We have made some modifications to the boring apes `BAYC` by changing it to `BAYC1155` which now follows the `ERC1155` standard and allows for free minting. The `_baseURI()` function has been modified to ensure that the `uri` for `BAYC1155` is the same as the `tokenURI` for `BAYC`. This means that `BAYC1155` metadata will be identical to that of boring apes.

## Remix Demo

### 1. Deploy the `BAYC1155` Contract
![Deploy](./img/40-1.jpg)

### 2. View Metadata `URI`
![View metadata](./img/40-2.jpg)

### 3. `mint` and view position changes
In the `mint` section, enter the account address, `id`, and quantity, and click the `mint` button to mint. If the quantity is `1`, it is a non-fungible token; if the quantity is greater than `1`, it is a fungible token.

![mint1](./img/40-3.jpg)

In the `blanceOf` section, enter the account address and `id` to view the corresponding position.

![mint2](./img/40-4.jpg)

### 4. Batch `mint` and view position changes

In the "mintBatch" section, input the "ids" array and the corresponding quantity to be minted. The length of both arrays must be the same. 
To view the recently minted token "id" array, input it as shown. 

Similarly, in the "transfer" section, we transfer tokens from an address that already owns them to a new address. This address can be a normal address or a contract address; if it is a contract address, it will be verified whether it has implemented the "onERC1155Received()" receiving function. 
Here, we transfer tokens to a normal address by inputting the "ids" and corresponding "amounts" arrays. 
To view the changes in holdings of the address to which tokens were just transferred, select "view balances".

## Summary

In this lesson, we learned about the `ERC1155` multi-token standard proposed by Ethereum's `EIP1155`. It allows for a contract to include multiple homogeneous or heterogeneous tokens. Additionally, we created a modified version of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) - `BAYC1155`: an `ERC1155` token containing 10,000 tokens with the same metadata as BAYC. Currently, `ERC1155` is primarily used in GameFi. However, I believe that as metaverse technology continues to develop, this standard will become increasingly popular.
